# Cluster

This is the final project of *WeChat Mini-program Design* course.  
Although all the git commits are authored and committed by [@RalXYZ](https://github.com/RalXYZ), 
in fact, this project has been splitted into three modules, 
and completed by three people: 
[@Tr1stanzz](https://github.com/Tr1stanzz), [@Wuxinberry](https://github.com/Wuxinberry) and [@RalXYZ](https://github.com/RalXYZ) respectively.  

For privacy concerns, some essential files like `project.config.json` have been ignored while committing. 
Hence, it is almost impossible for you to build this project.
